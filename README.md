# page pre-rendering

it is usually important for SEO, nextjs allows for returning a pre rendered page after the initial request made by the user (typically in react, the first document would be empty and have only a - root - component)

nextjs has 2 different native tools to deal with this issue

# static generation and server side rendering

- the code runs in different times of execution

# static generation

in static generation, the first snapshot is created during the production build
